# Predictive-Stock-Analysis
Stock analysis using various regression by implementing python libraries and discussing which regression yields the best results 


To run this project,

Open the project in VS code and hit run.

You will see prediction analysis graph for Google stock (A graph would show up) for a linear regression. 

Click on the cross on top left hand side to close the window and Apple stock would show up for that regression.

After seeing all regression, you will see which regression yielded best results which means it was the closest to actual data taken from yfinance. 

Make sure to read dpdf documentation, which covers the discussion of various regressions and procedure of the project in depth.
